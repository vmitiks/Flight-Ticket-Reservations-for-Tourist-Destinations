                    <p> 1. Contact the Airline: The first step is to get in touch with the airline's customer service or support. They should provide a clear and detailed explanation of the situation, including the booking reference or ticket number.<br>
                        2. Check Spam or Junk Folder: Sometimes, email confirmations and e-tickets may land in the recipient's spam or junk folder. It's a good practice to check these folders to ensure the ticket email wasn't misplaced.<br>
                        3. Request Resending: If the ticket email was indeed not received, the customer can request the airline to resend the ticket and related details. Ensure they provide the correct email address for the resend.<br>
                        4. Verify Payment: Make sure that the payment for the ticket was successfully processed. If there were any issues with payment, it could be the reason for not receiving the ticket.</p>

                    2. Look for Secure Websites: Ensure the website where you enter your payment information has "https" in the URL, indicating a secure connection. Look for a padlock icon in the address bar.<br>
                    3. Beware of Too-Good-to-Be-True Deals: Scammers often lure victims with extremely low prices. If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be cautious of websites offering significantly lower prices than competitors.
